# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: August 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the e-learning landing page from Frontend Mentor. Build header & hero section responsivly.

**Thoughts**: I spent a lot of time to learn React past few weeks. I really need time to pick up the Css properties. I hope I can build some memory muscles with this 100 days coding challenge!

### Day 2: August 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the grids and footer on this e-learning landing page from Frontend Mentor responsively.

**Thoughts**: This site looks simple but it really helps to remind me the flexbox and grids structure. grid-template-areas is my favourite tool. I also become more familiar with Sass feature and I tried seperate my css files in different foler structure. I'd like to use rem for my next project with the Sass custom function to convert rem to px.
