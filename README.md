### Day 1: August 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the e-learning landing page from Frontend Mentor. Build header & hero section responsivly.

### Day 2: August 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the grids and footer on this e-learning landing page from Frontend Mentor responsively.

**Thoughts**: This site looks simple but it really helps to remind me the flexbox and grids structure. grid-template-areas is my favourite tool. I also become more familiar with Sass feature and I tried seperate my css files in different foler structure. I'd like to use rem for my next project with the Sass custom function to convert rem to px.

### Day 3: August 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Beta version of a React app: Tic-Tac-Toe Game. Basic game logic, computer opponent and reset button included.

I would like to add multi-player feature, end game message on modal and store the winning record on browser storage soon.

### Day 4: August 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Updated the React app: Tic-Tac-Toe Game. Added overlays for restart and endgame. Now game records will store in the browser. Player can reset the record through the quit button.

### Day 5:  August 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Trying to make the three squares of the winning line changing its colour. I didn't work it out yet. But I learnt there are css properties of clip-path and mask-image that I can work with. 

**Thoughts**: Sometimes we will face a block and don't know what's the solution. But after I short break or work on something else, suddenly the idea will come out.

### Day 6:  August 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Now when the endgame line connect, the square will change color.

### Day 7:  August 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Home page is added. Now player can choose X or O to play.

### Day 8:  August 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I added the Multi-player mode on this React app: Tic-Tac-Toe. The player who chooses X will go first.

**Thoughts**: I only twisted some logic to turn cpu mode into multi-player mode. Now the code is a bit messy. I hope I can spend time to organize it and refactorize the code into more readable.
