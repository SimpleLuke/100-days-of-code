### Day 1: August 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the e-learning landing page from Frontend Mentor. Build header & hero section responsivly.

**Thoughts**: I spent a lot of time to learn React past few weeks. I really need time to pick up the Css properties. I hope I can build some memory muscles with this 100 days coding challenge!

### Day 2: August 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the grids and footer on this e-learning landing page from Frontend Mentor responsively.

**Thoughts**: This site looks simple but it really helps to remind me the flexbox and grids structure. grid-template-areas is my favourite tool. I also become more familiar with Sass feature and I tried seperate my css files in different foler structure. I'd like to use rem for my next project with the Sass custom function to convert rem to px.

### Day 3: August 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Beta version of a React app: Tic-Tac-Toe Game. Basic game logic, computer opponent and reset button included.

**Thoughts**: This project is my first React project besides the React online course. I get to familiar Hooks and props. I will consider to use Redux when the application become more complicated. I would like to add multi-player feature, end game message on modal and store the winning record on browser storage soon.

### Day 4: August 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Updated the React app: Tic-Tac-Toe Game. Added overlays for restart and endgame. Now game records will store in the browser. Player can reset the record through the quit button.

**Thoughts**: I am happy to add more features on this game. I can combine what I've learnt to my own application such as React Portal and local storage. I'd like to add features like color for connecting line, multi-player mode and a home menu for choosing X/O and mode.

### Day 5:  August 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Trying to make the three squares of the winning line changing its colour. I didn't work it out yet. But I learnt there are css properties of clip-path and mask-image that I can work with. 

**Thoughts**: Sometimes we will face a block and don't know what's the solution. But after I short break or work on something else, suddenly the idea will come out.

### Day 6:  August 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Now when the endgame line connect, the square will change color.

**Thoughts**: I thought about using the "clip-image" property, however, I find out maybe it would be better to filter the original O/X color.

### Day 7:  August 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Home page is added. Now player can choose X or O to play.

**Thoughts**: Now I understand when the application becomes more complicated, the code is also become not so clean. In future project, I should focus on the structure planning and using Redux.
