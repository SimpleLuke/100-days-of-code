### Day 1: August 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the e-learning landing page from Frontend Mentor. Build header & hero section responsivly.

**Thoughts**: I spent a lot of time to learn React past few weeks. I really need time to pick up the Css properties. I hope I can build some memory muscles with this 100 days coding challenge!

### Day 2: August 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the grids and footer on this e-learning landing page from Frontend Mentor responsively.

**Thoughts**: This site looks simple but it really helps to remind me the flexbox and grids structure. grid-template-areas is my favourite tool. I also become more familiar with Sass feature and I tried seperate my css files in different foler structure. I'd like to use rem for my next project with the Sass custom function to convert rem to px.

### Day 3: August 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Beta version of a React app: Tic-Tac-Toe Game. Basic game logic, computer opponent and reset button included.

**Thoughts**: This project is my first React project besides the React online course. I get to familiar Hooks and props. I will consider to use Redux when the application become more complicated. I would like to add multi-player feature, end game message on modal and store the winning record on browser storage soon.

### Day 4: August 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Updated the React app: Tic-Tac-Toe Game. Added overlays for restart and endgame. Now game records will store in the browser. Player can reset the record through the quit button.

**Thoughts**: I am happy to add more features on this game. I can combine what I've learnt to my own application such as React Portal and local storage. I'd like to add features like color for connecting line, multi-player mode and a home menu for choosing X/O and mode.

### Day 5:  August 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Trying to make the three squares of the winning line changing its colour. I didn't work it out yet. But I learnt there are css properties of clip-path and mask-image that I can work with. 

**Thoughts**: Sometimes we will face a block and don't know what's the solution. But after I short break or work on something else, suddenly the idea will come out.

### Day 6:  August 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Now when the endgame line connect, the square will change color.

**Thoughts**: I thought about using the "clip-image" property, however, I find out maybe it would be better to filter the original O/X color.

### Day 7:  August 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Home page is added. Now player can choose X or O to play.

**Thoughts**: Now I understand when the application becomes more complicated, the code is also become not so clean. In future project, I should focus on the structure planning and using Redux.

### Day 8:  August 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I added the Multi-player mode on this React app: Tic-Tac-Toe. The player who chooses X will go first.

**Thoughts**: I only twisted some logic to turn cpu mode into multi-player mode. Now the code is a bit messy. I hope I can spend time to organize it and refactorize the code into more readable.

### Day 9:  August 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I took the Advanced CSS course from Jonas Schmedtmann.

**Thoughts**: It is good to revision CSS techniques. Although I know CSS is not a programming language, I think it is important to master CSS for a web developer.

### Day 10:  August 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I continued the Advanced CSS course from Jonas Schmedtmann. Re-learn about float and clearfix. How to animate a flip card effect. Also, the 7-1 CSS Architecture with Sass.

**Thoughts**: Good to remind me building a responsive website is not just about media query. Don't use px, unless it is a very small value (it doesnt matter much after convertion.)

### Day 11:  August 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I build a home page along with Jonas Schmedtmann advanced css course. (media query is not included yet)

**Thoughts**: I learnt a lot of css animation techniques today. However, I think if I want to master it, I have to use those tricks a lot to make it my muscle memories.

### Day 12:  August 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Revision of Flexbox and Grid with Jonas Schmedtmann advanced css course.

**Thoughts**: With Flexbox and Grid, responsive website becomes more easy to manage than just depending on media query. Practice, practice, practice!

### Day 13:  August 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I built a responvie Equalizer landing page from Frontend Mentor challenge.

**Thoughts**: I try to use grid box for whole layout and small parts as well. At the beginning, I have to look back the decumentary to figure out the right layout. But once finished the setup, adjustment is very easy.

### Day 14:  August 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I worked on React authentication from Academind by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller React course.

**Thoughts**: I felt like I want to dive more into the concept of authentication tokens and API authentications.

### Day 15:  August 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I built a Search App with Freesound API. Fetching data with input keywords and the sound will be played automatically once the item is clicked by the user.

**Thoughts**: I spent more time than I thought I need to build around useEffect and useCallback hook. I need to spend more time to get familiar this part.

### Day 16:  August 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I built a responvie Meet landing page from Frontend Mentor challenge.

**Thoughts**: I spent too much time on some minor mistakes from using nested grids. I should think a faster & smarter way to do the layout.

### Day 17:  August 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I built 3 little projects from 50 projects in 50 days: Expanding Cards, Progress Steps and Rotating Navigation.

**Thoughts**: I dicided to get more fmailiar with vanilla JavaScript along with studying ReactJS framework. Fundamental is key.

### Day 18:  August 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I finished the React course today and got introduced to Jest testing.

**Thoughts**: I am going to build more big projects with ReactJs to get more in-depth experience. Also, starting to think about Test Driven Development.

### Day 19:  August 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Working with my clock app with API. You can click to refresh a new quote. Expanding details coming soon.

**Thoughts**: Netlify does not support API without https, so I add fallback dummy data on the live demo.
